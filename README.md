# **Boos & Brews Ball**

## **Site Overview**

The site is designed to promote a fictional Halloween event in Dublin, Ireland, as part of the 2023 Halloween Hackathon, organised by Code Institute. It was designed and deployed in four days, by a team of first-time Hackathon participants. The site used a home page to provide details of the site and the event, with a gallery page providing inspiration for fancy dress and a registration form. Additionally, a game, in the form of a Halloween inspired Rock, Paper, Scissors game, offers users a chance to access discounted tickets.

## **Planning stage**

A series of huddles were organised on the Slack platform and the team quickly decided on a name, 'Skeleton Crew' and a rough idea for a project. It was decided to try and assign tasks on different pages to reduce the likelihood of conflicts. A project board was set up to coordinate tasks to be completed. As the project progressed, and the pages were created, typography, colors and images were agreed upon and applied site wide.

### **Wireframes:**

Wireframes were used to map, out the design of the site on desktop and mobile devices.

### **Target Audiences:**

-   People looking for a Halloween adventure.

---

### **User Stories:**

-   As a user, I want to know what the site is about, so I can  quickly decide if I am interested.
-   As a user, I want to be able to see a gallery, so I can see what the suggested dress code is.
-   As a user, I want to be able to access a registration page, so I can sign up for the event.
-   As a user, I want to be able to play a game, so I can get a discounted ticket.

---

### **Site Aims:**

-   The aim of the site is to promote the event, providing users with a feel of halloween and an explanation of what to expect.  The site aims to drive users towards the registration form, where they can provide their details.  A game further entices users, by offering a chance to access a discount code for the event.

### **Color Scheme:**

-   Color were selected from the Coolors website, incorporating the Oranegs associated with pumpkins, the red of blood and complementary colours to provide contrast.

## **Typography**

-   The fonts used throughout the site were selected from Google Fonts.
-   The main font was selected for it's suitability towards the theme of Halloween, with 'blood' dripping from the letters.  Compleneting it is another spooky themed font, Creepster.
-   A contrasting font was used for clarity and readability throughout the site.

#### _Game Page:_

-   The game page provides users with a Halloween Challenge, playing a game of rock, paper, scissors, with Halloween themed icons. In this game, Pumkin beats Ghost (pumpkins ward off spirits), Ghost beats Death (you can't kill a ghost) and Death beats Pumpkin (by chopping it up).  When the user selects a ghoul from the top three icons, their choice is displayed below. After a short timeout, the computer's (Evil's) randomly selected choice is displayed. If there is a win or loss state, the points are incremented accordingly, along with a message reinforcing the state. Otherwise a 'draw' message is displayed.  When the player recahes a score of 9, an alert box is displayed, informing the user they have one and presenting them with a code and a link to the registration page.  If the computer reaches 9 first, a box appears telling the user they have lost, with an invitation to try again. At either point, the game is reset.  Below the game are two buttons, one of which explains the rules and the other resets the game.
